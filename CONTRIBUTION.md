After you clone the repo and install the dependencies, you should prepare the build setup by running the following command only for the first time:

```bash
npm run init-build
```

This will build and link each package.

*This will build and link all the packages.*

***

Use the following command to build each package separately

```bash
npm run build-core
npm run build-button
npm run build-buttons
```

Use the following command to build all packages

```bash
npm run build-all
```

Test your changes then submit your PR
